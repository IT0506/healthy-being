# HEALTHY-BEING
It's a project on Health Care Management and Information Retrieval System. 
The purpose of this application is to automate the complete process of an infirmary i.e., from the registration of a patient who came for an OP(out patient) Consultation to the discharge of an IP(in patient). It also includes the laboratory information system and ward management.

This system can be used as an online(intranet or internet) application for the users of an infirmary to automate their business processes. We can use this application for maintenance of the historical data of all the patients and their appointment, Lab Report, In-patient, Occupancy information.
